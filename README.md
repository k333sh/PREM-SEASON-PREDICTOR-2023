# ⚽ Premier League Match Outcome Predictor (2022/23)

This project is a Python-based machine learning model designed to predict the outcomes of Premier League matches from the 2022/23 season. It utilizes historical match data and team statistics to forecast results, with data manipulation powered by `pandas` and file handling via `os`.

## 📊 Model Performance

The current version of the model achieved **over 50% accuracy** in predicting match outcomes. While this is a promising start, there's significant room for improvement. Future iterations will aim to enhance prediction accuracy by incorporating more granular features, refining preprocessing techniques, and exploring advanced modeling strategies.

## 🔮 What's Next

Looking ahead to the upcoming Premier League season, the next version of this model will:

- Include player-level statistics and injury data
- Integrate live match feeds for real-time predictions
- Experiment with ensemble methods and deep learning architectures
- Improve feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **pandas** – for data wrangling and analysis
- **os** – for dynamic file path management
- *(Optional: Add scikit-learn, NumPy, or other libraries if used)*
